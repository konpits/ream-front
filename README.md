## Term 3 Assignment: Part B and Part C

### Problem
Our client is Coder Academy’s Operations and Client Services Team. When a prospective candidate applies for a course there is an admissions interview where they are scored based on an admissions matrix. The clients challenge is that their current admissions matrix utilises an across campus google sheet to analyse student responses in their admissions interview. This static sheet is while useful, not sufficient in it’s usability. Some of the sore spots for Coder Academy’s current admissions system are the following. 
- Coder Academy is seeking students that will be successful in the course, so the information they retrieve must be accurate and have the accessibility to be analysed. 
- The interviewer must remember interviewee responses for logging at a later time.
- Notes are made during the interview, then are required to be re-entered following into the Google sheet. 
- Multiple users using the Google sheet at the same time result in sheet errors and data loss.

### Solution 
We will be creating an app where Coder Academy interviewers can in real time log interview responses from candidates for reflection at a later time. This app will address the clients needs by saving time with live responses and ratings, resolving issues surrounding using a static Google sheet. The main goal of our app is to assist Coder Academy in selecting the best candidates for the course based on real, applicable data, relieving errors.

### Summary 
The app will be used during the admissions interview on an iPad. The interviewer will log in, and be able to enter new candidate details prior to the start of the interview. When the interview commences, the interviewer will be able to, in real time log responses from the candidate. At the end of the interview, the responses are submitted and an interview summary is displayed.  The answers are scored, and a total is provided to determine whether or not the candidate meets the admissions criteria. The interview data is saved, so the interviewer is able to access the information at a later time. By viewing all, the interviewer can not only view the most recent candidate’s scores, but all other candidates previously interviewed across campuses so the data can be analysed.
